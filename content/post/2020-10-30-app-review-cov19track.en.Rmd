## What is _"covid19tracker"_ package all about?

Today I am reviewing the [covid19tracker](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-xhee0013) package that has been masterfully developed by Xitong He. The _covid19tracker_ package primarily acts as a container for the _covid-19-tracker_ application that offers the user a deep dive into corona virus statistics for the following three countries:

 - Australia
 - China
 - United Kingdom, 

With a focus on the following covid19 statistics which are the number of daily: 

  - Confirmed cases 
  - Deaths 
  - Recovered individuals 

![_Figure 1: The covid-19-tracker application navbar_](/img/blog4/app-name-navbar.png) 

As shown in Figure 1, across three webpages the user is provided with an interactive, informative and comparative analysis of the chosen covid19 statistics for the chosen countries with covid19 figures provided for each province/capital city from each country from January to September and sourced from the `coronavirus` package which is provided by [RamiKrispin GitHub repo](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus). The analysis opens up with an interactive map which provides the user a selection of locations for each country that can be clicked in order to bring up a figure plotting the covid19 statistics for that location, with further analysis provided by clicking on elements of the map itself and producing a pie chart showing the proportional breakdown of the daily confirmed cases, daily deaths and daily recovered figures by month, as shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, along with the interactive analysis, the application also provides additional resources the can be accessed when the package is installed, which include:

  - Two data sets that can be used to recreate the analysis, which are:
    - _covid19_count_ that offers the COVID-19 statistics for the three countries.
    - _covid19_region_ that offers the COVID-19 statistics for each region of the three countries.
  - Three functions that can be used in conjunction with above datasets, which are:
    - _launch_app()_ this function generates and launches the the _covid-19-tracker_ application.
    - _input_option()_ which creates the shiny input options for the different variables which are contained in the data sets.
    - _summary_table()_ which creates a styled and formatted table to represent the summary case situation of COVID19 COVID19 in each country.
    
Each of these functions and an in depth explanation of the mechanics of the package, its elements and the provided analysis can be accessed through the package [covid19tracker website](https://etc5523-2020.github.io/r-package-assessment-xhee0013/index.html).

## Expectations and reality of the _covid19tracker_ package

I approached this package with intrigue given the climate we're in and the importance of staying up to date and aware of the global impact that corona virus is having, my initial expectation of the data that the package would provide came from the package title, _covid19tracker_, which instantly made clear that this package was providing access to covid19 statistics for locations around the world. With easy and clear instructions for installation and use via the README.md file, as shown in figure 3, the features of this package were easily and quickly accessible. 

![_Figure 3: Helpful and easily accessible install instructions_](/img/blog4/installation.png)

The application stored within this package, is the _covid-19-tracker_ application, which can be accessed with the _launch_app()_ function, my expectations were immediately met as the opening page jumps straight into analysis with the user being provided with an interactive analysis offering a time series and proportional break down of the following three statistics: daily confirmed cases, daily deaths and daily recovered individuals for three chosen countries, as listed above. A level of interactivity in order the ability for exploration into the covid19 statistics was something that was envisioned, once the informative _about_ page had been read, the opportunities for exploration on the _Country/Regions Plots_ page were made very clear and provided as a great guide to engage all the potent features provided to conduct ones own analysis. Although, the application within the package does meet the level of expectation of finding a range of covid19 statistics for various locations, it is a slightly misleading title given it offers the indication that there would be statistics across a vast range of countries, in conjunction with no specification of which countries or statistics will be analysed in the readme or the vignette leads for the expectation to be slightly calibrated to align with, what is, a terrific offering of interactive analysis. 

Furthermore, the provinces selected for the United Kingdom are slightly different to what was expected when looking into United Kingdom data, this came as a welcomed surprise given the information that was accessible for lesser known areas of the United Kingdom. Unfortunately it also does seem that the table providing a on the _Covid19-Case-Summary_ page may have an error when providing analysis for the monthly summaries of the United Kingdom, as it seems the "confirmed" and "Deaths" columns may have been labelled incorrectly, as the data shows that deaths out numbered daily confirmed cases.

Furthermore, access to certain features such as the data used for analysis was an element that was hoped to be included in order to better understand the analysis provided and recreate it, or take a further dive into the data and exploring from a different avenue, so it came with delight to find the datasets _covid19_count_ and _covid19_region_ included with the package. These datasets were easily accessed and instantly usable in any analysis that I, or any other user, wishes to conduct with the only slight draw back being that the documentation provided didn't offer the most in depth explanation of the variables selected, with a judgement needing to come from ones own opinion and educated guess, which wasn't hard to do it all. The inclusion of package functions to produce shiny and analytically output were also met with delight and appreciation for the work that Xitong has put in to developing this package, although not entirely expected, this did come as terrific addition, although some examples of how the functions work and maybe some slightly more in depth explanation of the variables would have allowed for an even greater appreciation of the functionality and usage of this package.

## Thoughts and recommendations

The package offers a variety of tools to explore, learn and analyse the impact of corona virus on the chosen three countries however, it could be worth noting for the developer that the documentation leaves the user lacking with a bit of clarity and understanding in whats exactly on offer and how it can be used. Documentation has been provided for every function and element of the package, which provides the user with a general understanding of the datasets provided and the functions of the package however, with the inclusion of examples of how to use the package functions as well as more detailed explanation of the variables being used in the data set would provide for a smoother and exploration process for the user, as with these additions I believe the full, and great, potential of this package could be unlocked!

![_Figure 4: Landing page of the covid-19-tracker application_](/img/blog4/app-front-page.png)

Taking a closer inspection into the terrifically developed shiny application, I have a few recommendations which may benefit the users experience with application. As figure 4, shows, the application opens up directly on the analysis page _Country/Regions Plots_ without any real context or explanation of what data the data application is providing for exploration. By accessing the _about_ page these details are made abundantly clear, it would be my recommendation that in the UI the _about_ page is the first tabpanel under the navbar, so when the user opens the application they are met with an informative explanation of the application and its contents. Given the informative and terrific _about_ page that has been provided to the user, it could an improvement for the application to spread some of the details surrounding the data being analysed and the interactivity of the application throughout the different web pages, that way when the user is exploring the data on either the _Country/Regions Plots_ or _Covid19-Case-Summary_ page they have clear instructions and guides as to how to access the data provided and what it is showing.

## What I learnt

The _covid19tracker_ package has provided me, and in my opinion any user, with a strong grasp of the impact that corona virus has had on Australia, China and the United Kingdom with regards to the daily cases, deaths and recovered persons. By accessing the datasets and applications within the package, it is evident that Australia faced its worst month in July for monthly confirmed cases with 9360 with August recording the highest number of monthly deaths with 456. Conversely, China showed to have their worst month earlier in the with February having 69,554 monthly confirmed cases and 2,624 monthly confirmed deaths. Interestingly, both Australia and China had the most recoveries in the months where they recorded the most deaths, with August for Australia and February for China. Unfortunately due to what seems like an error with the United Kingdom data, no inference can be taken away from the data provided. Which in itself, is a lesson to always check the output of the data being presented as well as ensuring exmaples and accurate guides and explanations for functions and elements within a package to ensure a smooth and informative experience for the user. 

Overall, the developer, Xitong He, has done a terrific job in producing this package and providing the general community with a great resource to look into the covid19 results for Australia and China, go check it out!
