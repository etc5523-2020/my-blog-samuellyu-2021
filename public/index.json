The two states in Ireland then becamse - the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, with populations of 4.904 million and 1.822 million (Dorney (2020)). The idea of an independent Ireland has been quite divisive, with the argument against Independence citing Ireland would not be able to economically stand on its own and the benefits of the UK health care system however, these arguments are now being considered weak and outdated. The current belief among many politicians and the public, is that Ireland could stand on its own financially and with the recent brexit vote, the conversation for independence, and to rid the Irish of the connection to their the brutal history, has been reignited (O’loughlan (2019)).\nThe global pandemic that is coronavirus has not only furthered but has aflame the discussion of independence, as given Ireland is split into two states - The republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, there is now a direct case study with coronavirus results as the proxy for the ability for Ireland to stand united against the benefits and of Northern Ireland remaining as part of the UK and Ireland stay divided. When the corona virus began to run rampid in Europe the Irish government offered clarity and clear instructions to combat the virus and acted quickly and decisively to implent a range of restrictions and health measures in order to get ontop of the highly contagious virus, as presented in Figure 1 (Mullally (2020)).\n Figure 1: Range of measures introduced by the Irish government  Figure 1 displays the number of health measures implented by the Irish government each month, with the density plots for each month showing the propotion of days spent with certain number of active measures each month. It was on the 13th of March Ireland had implemented school and universities were closes, stay home orders given to go with a total 15 social distance measures being implemented on the 24th which rose to 18 for the whole of April and through to may 17th. This period was accompanied with 5 moving restrictions being implented from the 28th of March travel restriction and border closure being among the 5, with the total number of movement restrictions reaching 8 from the 10th of April through to June 7th where they dropped to 5. As well as, a total of 21 public health measures to date (Mullally (2020)). As shown in Figure 2, the fast and swift decsion making saw Ireland control their death rates and daily cases, with the April being the worst month of daily cases however, a relatively fast decline from april to may as showin in plot (A), thus avoiding a catastrophic blow out on their citizens and health care system and given their ability to control the early breakout have kept at bay a second wave that has terrorised many other countries. Plot (B) of Figure 2 shows the daily deaths in Ireland, one unique observation is April 24th which was a reconciliation day where 185 probable deaths, that is deaths the person was suspected to have coronavirus howeever, not yet tested, were added to the tally. Similarly to plot(A), the swift policy decisions show a contained death tally and a second wave held at bay.\n Figure 2: Figure displaying the daily counts for cases and deaths in Ireland  While the Repbulic of Ireland was acting fast and making what can now be considered as the right decsions, Northern Ireland was left entangled with the UK slow reaction and what has been deemd failed response to covid, which saw the UK have relatively huge daily cases and death rates due to their lack of preperation of the medical system and implentation of appropriate policy (WalkerP (2020)). Given North Ireland is governed by the UK they also fell victim to the UK’s poor reaction to coronavirus and has highlighted how the Repblic of Ireland, when needed most, stood up for its countrymen and women and made the right decision, so maybe the next will a decision for independence?\n Wonderwoman, Batman, Superman and Coronavirus? What Wonderwoman, Batman and Superman all have in common is that they are crime fighers and it seems that coronavirus may be too. The extensive range of restrictive and public health measures that have been implemented by the government of Ireland have worked effectively to combat the deadly coronavirus however, as a side effect it seems that it has also led to an unprecedented reduction in crime. Figure 3 displays two plots, (A) and (B) that display the change in movement for Irish citizens since the the first social distancing measure was implented on the 12th of March 2020, as represented by the vertical black line.\n Figure 3: Figure showing the change in movement for Irish citizens  Plot (A) shows the Google community mobility reports for the frequence of attendance in groceries and pharmacies, parks and retail and recreation places, as a percentage to the baseline period which is Jan 3rd through to Feb 6th, 2020. While Plot (B) shows the Apple maps usafe for walking, driving and public transit direacitons as percentage relative to the baseline of Jan 13 2020. It is clear from the plot (B), that from the first restriction being implented there was a drastic change in the percentage of Apple maps usage which lasted through till May 17th when restrictions eased and a gradual rise is seen across driving, walking and transit. Plot (A) illustrates that frequenct of visits to retail and recreational areas dropped significantly from the first measure being introduced on March 12th all the way through to the first set of easements in May. Given the reduction in people movement and congregation at retail and recretional areas as well stay home order being in place Ireland saw a reduction in burglaries of -44%, shoplifting cases reduce by 39% and theft of motor vehicles and bicycles reduce by 43% (MacNamee (2020)), which has been attributed to the impact of the reactive policy to coronavirus.\nThus showing that maybe the police’s job isn’t so hard, or maybe, crime isn’t that hard to fight and all it takes is a pandemic!\n Acknowledgements and packages used Gassen (2020) Healy (2020) Wickham et al.

There have been a range of measures and policies issued by governments across the world to try combat and overcome the devastation that coronavirus has inflicted. Many of these measures involve social distancing, which can involve restricting the number of people that can be within a certain radius of each other as well as the number of people that can collectively be in a public space together, as such many proceedings requiring people to gather are now considered illegal and a risk to public health and safety resulting in their postponement or cancellation. An event such as an election would usually not have been considered it was safe or not, is now unable to go forward as, in order for an election to take place the citizens of a country are required to vote and in order to vote, the citizens need to congregate, usually there would be nothing unique about this statement however, given the global event that world has been stricken with, it would be seem an election would be a hard thing to pull off, that is, unless you’re Serbia.\nSerbia just recently held a parliamentary election on June 21st 2020 in the heart of the global pandemic that is the Coronavirus. Many citizens, pundits and opposing parties have raised concerns over the legitimacy of the election as many people believe it was wrought with the feeling of an authoritarian regime rather than a democratic election, given the option to vote were very limited due to the parliamentary boycott that took place whereby the Serbia Progressive Party (SNS) almost ran unopposed as their opposition boycotted the election. Given the boycot that took place, many reports indicate that the SNS were looking to have the election as soon as possible leading to falsified reports of the coronavirus impact and putting the nation’s health and safety at risk for the personal gain of the party[https://balkaninsight.com/2020/07/17/vucic-is-paying-a-price-for-serbias-bogus-elections/], which indicates coronavirus has had a significant impact on the election and this potential link will be further explored to assess how coronavirus may have assisted the SNS party into re-election.\n The Data The data used in the analysis has been sourced from the tidycovid19 package which has been developed by Joachim Gassen [https://github.com/joachim-gassen/tidycovid19] with data being pulled from: - The John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, - European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control - Our World in Data - World Bank - ACAPS, - Apple Maps - Oxford OxCGRT team\nThe key variables being: - Confirmed: Which is the accumualted confirmed coronavirus cases - Deaths: The accumulated conornavirus deaths - Soc_dist: The number of social distancing measures reported up to date by ACAPS, net of lifted restrictions\nFor the analysis to take place, the following variables were created: - Growth_factor: A measure of how fast the numbers of a new cases are going up or down. Which is calculated by taking the daily reported cases and dividing them by the average of the reported cases for the previous five days. by A growth factor above 1 indicates the numbers are going up and a growth factor below 1 indicates the virus is getting under control. [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-data-australia-growth-factor-covid-19/12132478?nw=0]. - Change_cases%: Measures the percent change in confirmed daily cases from the previous day.\n- Change_deaths%: Measures the percent change in confirmed deaths from the previous day.\n Serbia reacts to coronavirus Prior to being labelled a pandemic, the novel coronavirus had already run through countries like China and Italy causing mass devesation giving the virus global attention. On February 26th one of the presidents, Aleksandar Vucic, advisors making light of the virus referring to it as “the funniest virus” [https://balkaninsight.com/2020/04/03/serbia-pins-coronavirus-blame-on-returning-serbs-concealing-infection/] subsequently, the virus was labelled a pandemic on teh 11th of March and the Serbian president declared a state of emergency on the 15th of March [https://www.srbija.gov.rs/vest/en/151398/state-of-emergency-declared-throughout-serbia.php]. Figure 1 visualises both the counts for the daily confirmed cases and daily deaths for Serbia, with cases and deaths along the y axis and the date on the x axis. The verticle red lines indicate declerations of state of emergencies, the orange line indicates the state of emergency being called off and the blue line indicates the serbian election. It is evident that Serbia saw a steep accumulation of cases and deaths from the middle of May through to the middle of April and then a somewhat declining trend of cases and deaths from may through to the end of July where there was again a signifcant increase in cases and deaths.\n Figure 1: Visualises the daily counts for confirmed cases and deaths  dataTables_ScrollHeadInner { padding-right : 10px; }    {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/2020-09-04-5523-blog-one.en_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_summary-table-widget.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 2: Table displaying covid19 summary statistics for Serbia  Table 2 presents the growth factor, daily confirmed cases and deaths and percent change in daily confirmed cases and deaths since March, with Table 3 showing the monthly averages for those statistics. The recorded daily growth rate, percentage change in daily cases and deaths and daily cases and death count can be viewed through Table 2. By looking at Table 3 the averages for those statistics can viewed, which shows that in March and April the daily confirmed cases on average as growing and as growth factor was 1.129 and 1.036 showing the growth factor was consistently above 1 for two months straight andt the virus was not undercontrol. This resulting in social distancing measures to increase across March and April, as shown by Table 4 march was split between zero and one measure while 86.33% of April was spent with six social distancing restrictions in place. Although not intended, these measures also may have assisted the governemnt in quelling the anti-governemnt protest, which have been common in Serbia since the 90’s, that were being staged through the begining of 2020 by having legally imposed social distance restrictions https://www.rferl.org/a/belgrade-sees-saturday-full-of-protests/30413068.html\n  {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/2020-09-04-5523-blog-one.en_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_summary-ave-widget.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 3: Average of the key statistics  However, May looked quite different as Table 3 shows a growth factor dropping to 0.951 which is further visualised by the steep drop in cases that can be seen at the end of April in Figure 1 visuaulises, with the pandemic being declared beaten on the 6th of May as shown by the orange line.\nThe reduced figures as claimed by BIRN were a result of the real numbers bring covered up [https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2020/06/25/serbia-covered-up-the-real-number-of-covid-19-cases-before-elections-claims-birn/]. During this period the government declared the fight won with the president praising the work he and his team did to combat the virus and such allowed gatherings, sports events and loosened up restricitons over May [https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2020/06/25/serbia-covered-up-the-real-number-of-covid-19-cases-before-elections-claims-birn/], which is in stark contrast to the restrictions that were some Europes tightest being imposed days before. The easement of restrictions and declartion of victory over Coronavirus seemed to have been part of the election campaign to promote for re-election, given the boycot of the other parties, if there was to be an election the SNS would be practically unopposed. Furthermore, given the health risk that many thought was still present [https://balkaninsight.com/2020/06/25/why-everyone-lost-out-in-serbias-elections/], there was on record the lowest turn out of voters further playing into the hands of the SNS.\n  {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/2020-09-04-5523-blog-one.en_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_measure-widget-plot.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 4: Table displaying the proportion each measure has been used in each month  As a result, on June 21st 2020 an election was held and the SNS were re-elected back into parliament. On the morning after the election, Dr Predrag Kon, one of the most recogisable expert at the Crisis Staff of the Government of Serbia announced the situation has worsened, which is shown by the growth factor of 1.068 for June, which mostly came towards the end of June, and 1.017 for July subsequently leading to the Serbian government announcing a second state of emergency on July 3rd. Thus potentially showing that the coronavirus was used somewhat like a tool by the Serbian parliement in power in order to have their party re-elected.\nThat’s a one for one in election campaigns for Covid19!\n ","date":1599177600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599150049,"objectID":"fc70baf9536a30177aa16c3b8b4e767e","permalink":"/post/blog_one/5523-blog-one/","publishdate":"2020-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/blog_one/5523-blog-one/","section":"post","summary":"An analysis of the impact that coronavirus had on the Serbian parliamentary election.","tags":["Serbia","Coronavirus"],"title":"Coronavirus An Effective Campaign Strategy","type":"post"},{"authors":["Samuel Lyubic"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.
