As detailed in the “About” section, there is a long standing and divisive history of conflict and war between the two countries that stems from Ireland’s plight for seeking their independence from the United Kingdom. Corona virus has presented pundits who are pro independence with a case study to further ignite and push the fight for independence, with the difference in impact and response between Ireland and the United Kingdom acting as a proxy for Ireland’s ability to stand completely independent.As a follow on from my blog post “Success in the face of coronavirus? Maybe.” this application provides the user with interactive tools to analyse and compare a range of corona virus statistics and responses between the two countries and assess the case study for themselves.\n\n Where can you go? The applications navigation bar\n This application provides four web pages that the user can navigate across by accessing the navigation bar that can be found along the top border of the app. The navigation bar list four separate sections, they are:\nAbout Cases, Deaths and Government Intervention Movement Analysis References and acknowledgements  \n What can you learn? \nAbout page Figure 1: “About” page from the “Covid19: The Battle of independence” app.\n The application opens up on the _“About” page which provides the user with an informative breakdown of the purpose behind building the app by succinctly detailing the history between Ireland and the United Kingdom and the how corona virus is being used as a case study to fuel the plight of for complete Irish independence. As well. as providing information on the creator of the application.\n\n Cases, Deaths and Government Intervention Figure 2: “The Cases, Deaths and Government Intervention” page showing the side bar and on the left and the figure output on the right\n This section contains an interactive comparative analysis between the two countries across each of the following four statistics:\nDaily Cases Daily Deaths Cumulative cases Cumulative deaths Government intervention (through restrictions, measures and public policy).  The page is split into two halves, one being the side bar panel on the left hand side providing the user with interactive selection capabilities whereby the selection made will be presented in the main panel in the form of a figure visualizing any one of the chosen statistics or a table detailing the government intervention for either both or one of Ireland or Great Britain.\nAs expressed, the user has the opportunity to select the statistic that they wish to comparatively analyse from the side bar panel and that will automatically update the interactive figure on the main page with a comparison between Ireland and Great Britain for the chosen statistic. As shown in Figure 2, the output presents a time series line plot with the data on the x axis and the specific count or government measure on the y axis. The figure offers the user extensive interactive capabilities for them to explore the data and conduct analysis. By hovering over the corresponding line plots of the they can access information regarding: date and number of restriction/government measures in place for each nation. Furthermore, the figure offers the ability to zoom in on any section of the plot allowing the user to highlight and manipulate the plot as they please and by clicking the country names in the legend, titled Countries, the plot can be isolated for one country and the chosen variable can be individually analysed. The drop down selection box at the top of the side bar on the left hand panel provides the user with access to an extensive range of variables to select, they are as follows:\nFigure 3: Drop down selection tool.\n  Cumulative Confirmed Cases per capita, 100,000 Daily Death Total per capita, 100, 000 Cumulative Death per capita, 100,000 Daily Confirmed Cases Cumulative Deaths Daily Confirmed Deaths Daily Confirmed Cases per capita, 100,000 Log of Cumulative Confirmed Cases Log of Daily Confirmed Cases Log of Cumulative Deaths Social distancing measures Movement Restrictions Public Health Measures  The application also provides a date range selector shown below: Whereby both the Figure 2 and Figure 5 will be updated to show the recorded results for the chosen date range, giving the user extreme flexibility to analyse any variable across any date range of their choosing. The date range selector is linked to both the figure and the table presented below, by updating the date range for a chosen variable the user will see the corresponding percentage breakdown of measures, restrictions and policies for the chosen date range, thus allowing the user to visualize the types of government intervention that impacted and led to changes in the trends for the chosen variable.\nFigure 5: Table presenting the monthly percentage breakdown for the range of measures, restriction and policies enacted across: social distance measures, movement restrictions and public healthy policy.\n The interactive table displayed in Figure 5 provides a grouped monthly percentage breakdown across the number of measures, restrictions and policies enacted by both Ireland and United Kingdom for the following three types of government intervention:\nNumber of social distance measures Number of movement restrictions Number of introduced public health policies  Here the user can you navigate across the percentage breakdown of the three types of government intervention by accessing tabs that are situated below the the heading “Government intervention” for both countries, with the United Kingdom (GBR) colored red and Ireland colored in green. The percentage break down of measures, restrictions and polices have been grouped together into small brackets to provide the analysis in a more interpretable and presentable form thus allowing the user to assess the difference in timing and implementation of government intervention tactics in order to combat Corona virus. The interactiveness of the table allows the user to filter the rows by their chosen range of measures by clicking the arrow at the top of each column thus allowing the user to assess the difference in application of the number of measures, restrictions and polices between the two countries. The user also has the option of deselecting one of the countries in the side bar panel in order to only see the results for one country, which is the tick box option displayed to the left of the table presented in Figure 5.\n\n Movement analysis Figure 6: Mobility analysis landing page\n As a follow on analysis from data presented in the previous section, Figure 6 displays the Mobility analysis page. This section provides the user with the interactive analysis on the impact that covid19 government intervention has had on the mobility of residents of the major cities in both Ireland and the United Kingdom. The user is presented with a country map of either Ireland or the United Kingdom and it is up to them which country they select as this interactive map can be changed by selecting the desired country from the drop down box in the side bar, on the left hand side of Figure 6. The points on the map highlight the major cities for both countries with the size of the points being representative of the population size of the city. The interactiveness of the map allows the user to click on the highlighted cities to then generate the mobility data in the corresponding figure for the residents of that city, as shown in figure 7.\nFigure 7: Displays the figure that visualises the mobility analysis for the chosen city when it is clicked on by the user from the map shown in Figure 6\n When produced, Figure 7 sits below the map shown in Figure 6 and displays the movement trends of residents in the following three forms of transport:\nDriving Transit Walking  Which are recorded by apple maps who provide an activity score that is based off of the apple maps usage with regards to the relative volume of requested directions for driving compared to a baseline volume on January 13th, 2020. The activity score is indexed at 100, which is represented by the black line in the figure, thus any deviation around the index demonstrates a percentage change from the base line date. The figure displays interactive qualities whereby by each mode of transport can be isolated by selecting or deselecting the mode of transport in the legend titled “Transportation” as well as by hovering over the lines themselves the user will receive specific information regarding the date and apple score for that particular point in time, thus providing the user with the ability to take an in-depth look at the impact and timing that the government intervention with corona virus has had on mobility across the key cities of both countries to make an assessment of whether or not the appropriate action was taken as can be now deemed as required.\n\n  So, what’s great about this app? The large range of variables that the user can choose to explore the difference in handling of corona virus between the two countries   As detailed in the “What can you learn?” section, the app provides the user with over 20 different variables and statistics for the user to explore across both countries allowing for an extensive analysis and assessment of the handling of corona virus in order to conclude for themselves if in fact the handling of corona virus does or does not present a strong case study for Irish independence.  The interactive capabilities   Both section, “Cases, Deaths and Government Intervention” and “Mobility Analysis”, are filled with interactive elements that allow the user to tailor the output to suit the analysis they wish to conduct. By being able to to produce output for an extensive range of variables across any date range for either one or both countries partnered with the ability to hone in on data relating to specific dates by interacting with figures themselves, the user is provided with a vast array of tools and ability to explore the data and tailor the output to investigate the important features they identify and wish to understand, keeping the user both informed and engaged.  Flow of information   The analysis in sections “Cases, Deaths and Government Intervention” and “Mobility Analysis” flow naturally with one another, providing for an intriguing narrative and data exploration for the user.  \n And what can be improved? 1. The aesthetics of the application  The color scheme is slightly bland and could have been made more visually appealing with the addition of better styling and imagery in order to better engage the user   2. Stronger link illustrated between “Cases, Deaths and Government Intervention” and “Mobility Analysis” sections  Although the analysis sections flow well, a strong link could have been detailed for the user.   3. Improved explanation of interactive elements  The explanations for the interactive elements could have been written in a more descriptive and specific manner, to better inspire the user to engage with them and explore the data.  \n  Creator Additions! As the creator of the application I can see improvements that could be made to better the user experience in order to allow them to gain a deeper understanding of the data provided, they are:\nImprove the visual appeal with better CSS styling and inclusion of imagery to better illustrate the dynamic between Ireland and the United Kingdom as well as how to operate the application. - Including updating the map imagery Add Google movement comparisons for both countries to bolster the mobility analysis Adding an interactive animation of counts and the change over time in mobility for the two countries with respect to the government intervention by selecting the form of government intervention and seeing how the addition or subtraction of the measures, restrictions or policies specific to that from of intervention have impacted both countries.  \n As the creator what I’d love to add? If the data permitted, the inclusion of the length of time for parliamentary decisions to go from being proposed to passed, regarding corona virus intervention strategies. This would be a beneficial addition of information if it were available in order to further bolster the users knowledge,understanding and ability to decipher between the operations of the two governments in relation to their response to corona virus.\n If the data were to permit, an ability to isolate and quantify the current government intervention strategies (social distance measures, movement restrictions and public health policy) in order to understand their individual direct impact on their curvature of the corona virus growth trend and then be able to cross examine against the cost of implementation in order to assess which governments, if any, made the tougher/costlier decisions for the benefits of their citizens, if that were to be the case.\n What would be really special and informative would be to add a virtual reality element to the application that allows the user to step into the application and explore the history between the Ireland and United Kingdom and the data by engaging with it directly in the virtual realm, resulting in the most interactive, engaging and informative experience possible.\n  Thanks for reading and happy learning!

The two states in Ireland then becamse - the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, with populations of 4.904 million and 1.822 million (Dorney (2020)). The idea of an independent Ireland has been quite divisive, with the argument against Independence citing Ireland would not be able to economically stand on its own and the benefits of the UK health care system however, these arguments are now being considered weak and outdated. The current belief among many politicians and the public, is that Ireland could stand on its own financially and with the recent brexit vote, the conversation for independence, and to rid the Irish of the connection to their the brutal history, has been reignited (O’loughlan (2019)).\nThe global pandemic that is coronavirus has not only furthered but has aflame the discussion of independence, as given Ireland is split into two states - The republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, there is now a direct case study with coronavirus results as the proxy for the ability for Ireland to stand united against the benefits and of Northern Ireland remaining as part of the UK and Ireland stay divided. When the corona virus began to run rampid in Europe the Irish government offered clarity and clear instructions to combat the virus and acted quickly and decisively to implent a range of restrictions and health measures in order to get ontop of the highly contagious virus, as presented in Figure 1 (Mullally (2020)).\n Figure 1: Range of measures introduced by the Irish government  Figure 1 displays the number of health measures implented by the Irish government each month, with the density plots for each month showing the propotion of days spent with certain number of active measures each month. It was on the 13th of March Ireland had implemented school and universities were closes, stay home orders given to go with a total 15 social distance measures being implemented on the 24th which rose to 18 for the whole of April and through to may 17th. This period was accompanied with 5 moving restrictions being implented from the 28th of March travel restriction and border closure being among the 5, with the total number of movement restrictions reaching 8 from the 10th of April through to June 7th where they dropped to 5. As well as, a total of 21 public health measures to date (Mullally (2020)). As shown in Figure 2, the fast and swift decsion making saw Ireland control their death rates and daily cases, with the April being the worst month of daily cases however, a relatively fast decline from april to may as showin in plot (A), thus avoiding a catastrophic blow out on their citizens and health care system and given their ability to control the early breakout have kept at bay a second wave that has terrorised many other countries. Plot (B) of Figure 2 shows the daily deaths in Ireland, one unique observation is April 24th which was a reconciliation day where 185 probable deaths, that is deaths the person was suspected to have coronavirus howeever, not yet tested, were added to the tally. Similarly to plot(A), the swift policy decisions show a contained death tally and a second wave held at bay.\n Figure 2: Figure displaying the daily counts for cases and deaths in Ireland  While the Repbulic of Ireland was acting fast and making what can now be considered as the right decsions, Northern Ireland was left entangled with the UK slow reaction and what has been deemd failed response to covid, which saw the UK have relatively huge daily cases and death rates due to their lack of preperation of the medical system and implentation of appropriate policy (WalkerP (2020)). Given North Ireland is governed by the UK they also fell victim to the UK’s poor reaction to coronavirus and has highlighted how the Repblic of Ireland, when needed most, stood up for its countrymen and women and made the right decision, so maybe the next will a decision for independence?\n Wonderwoman, Batman, Superman and Coronavirus? What Wonderwoman, Batman and Superman all have in common is that they are crime fighers and it seems that coronavirus may be too. The extensive range of restrictive and public health measures that have been implemented by the government of Ireland have worked effectively to combat the deadly coronavirus however, as a side effect it seems that it has also led to an unprecedented reduction in crime. Figure 3 displays two plots, (A) and (B) that display the change in movement for Irish citizens since the the first social distancing measure was implented on the 12th of March 2020, as represented by the vertical black line.\n Figure 3: Figure showing the change in movement for Irish citizens  Plot (A) shows the Google community mobility reports for the frequence of attendance in groceries and pharmacies, parks and retail and recreation places, as a percentage to the baseline period which is Jan 3rd through to Feb 6th, 2020. While Plot (B) shows the Apple maps usafe for walking, driving and public transit direacitons as percentage relative to the baseline of Jan 13 2020. It is clear from the plot (B), that from the first restriction being implented there was a drastic change in the percentage of Apple maps usage which lasted through till May 17th when restrictions eased and a gradual rise is seen across driving, walking and transit. Plot (A) illustrates that frequenct of visits to retail and recreational areas dropped significantly from the first measure being introduced on March 12th all the way through to the first set of easements in May. Given the reduction in people movement and congregation at retail and recretional areas as well stay home order being in place Ireland saw a reduction in burglaries of -44%, shoplifting cases reduce by 39% and theft of motor vehicles and bicycles reduce by 43% (MacNamee (2020)), which has been attributed to the impact of the reactive policy to coronavirus.\nThus showing that maybe the police’s job isn’t so hard, or maybe, crime isn’t that hard to fight and all it takes is a pandemic!\n Acknowledgements and packages used Gassen (2020) Healy (2020) Wickham et al.

There have been a range of measures and policies issued by governments across the world to try combat and overcome the devastation that coronavirus has inflicted. Many of these measures involve social distancing, which can involve restricting the number of people that can be within a certain radius of each other as well as the number of people that can collectively be in a public space together, as such many proceedings requiring people to gather are now considered illegal and a risk to public health and safety resulting in their postponement or cancellation. An event such as an election would usually not have been considered it was safe or not, is now unable to go forward as, in order for an election to take place the citizens of a country are required to vote and in order to vote, the citizens need to congregate, usually there would be nothing unique about this statement however, given the global event that world has been stricken with, it would be seem an election would be a hard thing to pull off, that is, unless you’re Serbia.\nSerbia just recently held a parliamentary election on June 21st 2020 in the heart of the global pandemic that is the Coronavirus. Many citizens, pundits and opposing parties have raised concerns over the legitimacy of the election as many people believe it was wrought with the feeling of an authoritarian regime rather than a democratic election, given the option to vote were very limited due to the parliamentary boycott that took place whereby the Serbia Progressive Party (SNS) almost ran unopposed as their opposition boycotted the election. Given the boycot that took place, many reports indicate that the SNS were looking to have the election as soon as possible leading to falsified reports of the coronavirus impact and putting the nation’s health and safety at risk for the personal gain of the party[https://balkaninsight.com/2020/07/17/vucic-is-paying-a-price-for-serbias-bogus-elections/], which indicates coronavirus has had a significant impact on the election and this potential link will be further explored to assess how coronavirus may have assisted the SNS party into re-election.\n The Data The data used in the analysis has been sourced from the tidycovid19 package which has been developed by Joachim Gassen [https://github.com/joachim-gassen/tidycovid19] with data being pulled from: - The John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, - European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control - Our World in Data - World Bank - ACAPS, - Apple Maps - Oxford OxCGRT team\nThe key variables being: - Confirmed: Which is the accumualted confirmed coronavirus cases - Deaths: The accumulated conornavirus deaths - Soc_dist: The number of social distancing measures reported up to date by ACAPS, net of lifted restrictions\nFor the analysis to take place, the following variables were created: - Growth_factor: A measure of how fast the numbers of a new cases are going up or down. Which is calculated by taking the daily reported cases and dividing them by the average of the reported cases for the previous five days. by A growth factor above 1 indicates the numbers are going up and a growth factor below 1 indicates the virus is getting under control. [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-data-australia-growth-factor-covid-19/12132478?nw=0]. - Change_cases%: Measures the percent change in confirmed daily cases from the previous day.\n- Change_deaths%: Measures the percent change in confirmed deaths from the previous day.\n Serbia reacts to coronavirus Prior to being labelled a pandemic, the novel coronavirus had already run through countries like China and Italy causing mass devesation giving the virus global attention. On February 26th one of the presidents, Aleksandar Vucic, advisors making light of the virus referring to it as “the funniest virus” [https://balkaninsight.com/2020/04/03/serbia-pins-coronavirus-blame-on-returning-serbs-concealing-infection/] subsequently, the virus was labelled a pandemic on teh 11th of March and the Serbian president declared a state of emergency on the 15th of March [https://www.srbija.gov.rs/vest/en/151398/state-of-emergency-declared-throughout-serbia.php]. Figure 1 visualises both the counts for the daily confirmed cases and daily deaths for Serbia, with cases and deaths along the y axis and the date on the x axis. The verticle red lines indicate declerations of state of emergencies, the orange line indicates the state of emergency being called off and the blue line indicates the serbian election. It is evident that Serbia saw a steep accumulation of cases and deaths from the middle of May through to the middle of April and then a somewhat declining trend of cases and deaths from may through to the end of July where there was again a signifcant increase in cases and deaths.\n Figure 1: Visualises the daily counts for confirmed cases and deaths  dataTables_ScrollHeadInner { padding-right : 10px; }    {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/2020-09-04-5523-blog-one.en_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_summary-table-widget.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 2: Table displaying covid19 summary statistics for Serbia  Table 2 presents the growth factor, daily confirmed cases and deaths and percent change in daily confirmed cases and deaths since March, with Table 3 showing the monthly averages for those statistics. The recorded daily growth rate, percentage change in daily cases and deaths and daily cases and death count can be viewed through Table 2. By looking at Table 3 the averages for those statistics can viewed, which shows that in March and April the daily confirmed cases on average as growing and as growth factor was 1.129 and 1.036 showing the growth factor was consistently above 1 for two months straight andt the virus was not undercontrol. This resulting in social distancing measures to increase across March and April, as shown by Table 4 march was split between zero and one measure while 86.33% of April was spent with six social distancing restrictions in place. Although not intended, these measures also may have assisted the governemnt in quelling the anti-governemnt protest, which have been common in Serbia since the 90’s, that were being staged through the begining of 2020 by having legally imposed social distance restrictions https://www.rferl.org/a/belgrade-sees-saturday-full-of-protests/30413068.html\n  {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/2020-09-04-5523-blog-one.en_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_summary-ave-widget.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 3: Average of the key statistics  However, May looked quite different as Table 3 shows a growth factor dropping to 0.951 which is further visualised by the steep drop in cases that can be seen at the end of April in Figure 1 visuaulises, with the pandemic being declared beaten on the 6th of May as shown by the orange line.\nThe reduced figures as claimed by BIRN were a result of the real numbers bring covered up [https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2020/06/25/serbia-covered-up-the-real-number-of-covid-19-cases-before-elections-claims-birn/]. During this period the government declared the fight won with the president praising the work he and his team did to combat the virus and such allowed gatherings, sports events and loosened up restricitons over May [https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2020/06/25/serbia-covered-up-the-real-number-of-covid-19-cases-before-elections-claims-birn/], which is in stark contrast to the restrictions that were some Europes tightest being imposed days before. The easement of restrictions and declartion of victory over Coronavirus seemed to have been part of the election campaign to promote for re-election, given the boycot of the other parties, if there was to be an election the SNS would be practically unopposed. Furthermore, given the health risk that many thought was still present [https://balkaninsight.com/2020/06/25/why-everyone-lost-out-in-serbias-elections/], there was on record the lowest turn out of voters further playing into the hands of the SNS.\n  {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/2020-09-04-5523-blog-one.en_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_measure-widget-plot.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Figure 4: Table displaying the proportion each measure has been used in each month  As a result, on June 21st 2020 an election was held and the SNS were re-elected back into parliament. On the morning after the election, Dr Predrag Kon, one of the most recogisable expert at the Crisis Staff of the Government of Serbia announced the situation has worsened, which is shown by the growth factor of 1.068 for June, which mostly came towards the end of June, and 1.017 for July subsequently leading to the Serbian government announcing a second state of emergency on July 3rd. Thus potentially showing that the coronavirus was used somewhat like a tool by the Serbian parliement in power in order to have their party re-elected.\nThat’s a one for one in election campaigns for Covid19!\n ","date":1599177600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599150049,"objectID":"aa984cc78e9c7fae76133718e81ddf0a","permalink":"/post/5523-blog-one/","publishdate":"2020-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/5523-blog-one/","section":"post","summary":"An analysis of the impact that coronavirus had on the Serbian parliamentary election.","tags":["Serbia","Coronavirus"],"title":"Coronavirus An Effective Campaign Strategy","type":"post"},{"authors":["Samuel Lyubic"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.
